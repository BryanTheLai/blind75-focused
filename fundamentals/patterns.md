## Overview

Your goal is to pass technical interviews at elite AI and Backend teams. The questions they ask are not random trivia; they are tests of your fundamental problem-solving patterns. This guide distills the 40+ problems in your Tier S and Tier A lists into **7 core, reusable patterns.**

Master these patterns, and you will be ableto solve over 90% of the required problems efficiently and elegantly. We will move from most to least critical.

### **Pattern 1: The One-Pass Hash Map**

üß† **Core Idea:** Iterate through your data once. Use a hash map (a Python `dict`) to store information you've already seen (`value -> index`, `character -> count`, etc.). On each new element, use your map to make an immediate decision. This pattern trades space for O(1) lookup time.

üí° **When to Use (Problem Triggers):**
*   "Find two numbers that sum to a target"
*   "Find duplicates"
*   "Check for anagrams" (by character counts)
*   "Group items by a property"

‚öôÔ∏è **The Code Template:**
```python
# Generic template
def hash_map_pattern(items):
    seen_map = {}
    for i, item in enumerate(items):
        # 1. Look for a complementary value in the map
        complement = calculate_complement(item)
        if complement in seen_map:
            # 2. If found, you have a solution.
            return create_result(i, seen_map[complement])

        # 3. If not found, store the current item's info.
        seen_map[item] = i
    
    # 4. Return a default if loop finishes.
    return default_value
```

‚úÖ **Applying the Pattern: `2 Sum`**
```python
# Solves LeetCode "2 Sum"
def two_sum(nums, target):
    seen_map = {} # Maps value -> index
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen_map:
            return [seen_map[complement], i] # Found it!
        
        seen_map[num] = i # Store current number and its index
```

---

### **Pattern 2: The Sliding Window**

üß† **Core Idea:** Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define a "window" over a sequence. Expand the window by moving `right`. When the window is no longer "valid" based on some condition, shrink it by moving `left`. This is the most efficient way to solve problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.

üí° **When to Use (Problem Triggers):**
*   "Longest/shortest substring/subarray"
*   "Best time to buy and sell"
*   Problems involving "contiguous" elements.

‚öôÔ∏è **The Code Template:**
```python
# Generic template
def sliding_window_pattern(sequence):
    left = 0
    max_result = 0
    window_state = initialize_state() # e.g., a set or a dict

    for right, item in enumerate(sequence):
        # 1. Add the right element to the window state
        update_state_add(window_state, item)

        # 2. Check if the window is still valid. If not, shrink it.
        while not is_window_valid(window_state):
            # 3. Remove the left element from the state and move the left pointer
            update_state_remove(window_state, sequence[left])
            left += 1

        # 4. Update the result with the current valid window size
        max_result = max(max_result, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_result
```

‚úÖ **Applying the Pattern: `Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters`**
```python
# Solves LeetCode "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"
def length_of_longest_substring(s):
    left = 0
    max_len = 0
    chars_in_window = set() # Our window state

    for right, char in enumerate(s):
        # If char is already in window, shrink from the left until it's not
        while char in chars_in_window:
            chars_in_window.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        
        # Add the new char and update the max length
        chars_in_window.add(char)
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
        
    return max_len
```
---

### **Pattern 3: The 2 Pointers (Converging or Same-Direction)**

üß† **Core Idea:** A simplified version of the sliding window. Use two pointers that move through a sequence to find a pair or a state. They can either move towards each other (from opposite ends of a sorted array) or in the same direction at different speeds.

üí° **When to Use (Problem Triggers):**
*   "In a sorted array..."
*   "Find a pair that meets a condition"
*   "Find a palindrome"
*   Problems where you can discard half the search space based on a comparison.

‚öôÔ∏è **The Code Template (Converging):**
```python
# Generic template for converging pointers
def converging_pointers_pattern(sorted_items):
    left = 0
    right = len(sorted_items) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = sorted_items[left] + sorted_items[right]
        
        if current_sum == target:
            return found_solution(left, right)
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1 # Need a bigger sum
        else: # current_sum > target
            right -= 1 # Need a smaller sum
```

‚úÖ **Applying the Pattern: `Container With Most Water`**
```python
# Solves LeetCode "Container With Most Water"
def max_area(height):
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1
    max_water = 0
    
    while left < right:
        # Calculate area with the shortest wall as the height
        h = min(height[left], height[right])
        w = right - left
        max_water = max(max_water, h * w)
        
        # Move the pointer of the shorter wall inward
        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
            
    return max_water
```
---

### **Pattern 4: Recursive Tree Traversal (DFS)**

üß† **Core Idea:** To solve a problem for a tree, assume you can magically solve it for its left and right children. A function that calls itself on `node.left` and `node.right` and then combines the results is the cleanest way to traverse and compute on a tree. This is Depth-First Search (DFS).

üí° **When to Use (Problem Triggers):**
*   Any problem involving a binary tree.
*   "Find the depth/height"
*   "Check if two trees are identical"
*   "Validate a property of the tree" (e.g., is it a valid BST?)
*   "Find a path"

‚öôÔ∏è **The Code Template:**
```python
# Generic template for tree DFS
def dfs(node):
    # 1. Base Case: What to do at the end of a branch?
    if not node:
        return base_case_value # e.g., 0, True, None

    # 2. Recursive Step: Call the function on children
    left_result = dfs(node.left)
    right_result = dfs(node.right)

    # 3. Combine Step: Use the children's results to solve for the current node
    return combine(node.val, left_result, right_result)
```

‚úÖ **Applying the Pattern: `Maximum Depth of Binary Tree`**
```python
# Solves LeetCode "Maximum Depth of Binary Tree"
def max_depth(root):
    # Base Case: An empty tree has 0 depth.
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    # Recursive Step: Get depth of left and right subtrees.
    left_depth = max_depth(root.left)
    right_depth = max_depth(root.right)
    
    # Combine Step: The depth is 1 (for the current node) + the max of child depths.
    return 1 + max(left_depth, right_depth)
```

### **Pattern 5: Binary Search on a "Conceptual" Sorted Space**

üß† **Core Idea:** Efficiently search a *sorted* collection by repeatedly cutting the search space in half. The key is that the "collection" might not be a simple array; it could be a range of numbers (from `1` to `N`) or the space of possible answers. The core logic remains the same.

üí° **When to Use (Problem Triggers):**
*   "Search in a sorted array"
*   "Find the first element that..."
*   The problem can be phrased as a "yes/no" question (e.g., "is it possible to achieve X with a value of at least Y?")

‚öôÔ∏è **The Code Template:**
```python
# Generic template for binary search
def binary_search_pattern(search_space):
    left, right = get_search_space_bounds(search_space)
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        # The core logic is in your condition
        if condition(mid):
            # Move 1 way (e.g., search for a smaller value)
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            # Move the other way (e.g., search for a larger value)
            left = mid + 1
            
    return final_answer
```

‚úÖ **Applying the Pattern: `Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array`**
```python
# Solves LeetCode "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array"
def find_min(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    res = nums[0]
    
    while left <= right:
        # If the subarray is already sorted, its first element is the minimum
        if nums[left] < nums[right]:
            res = min(res, nums[left])
            break

        mid = (left + right) // 2
        res = min(res, nums[mid])

        # Key Insight: The minimum is in the "unsorted" part of the array.
        # If the mid-point is part of the sorted left portion...
        if nums[mid] >= nums[left]:
            # ...the minimum must be in the right portion.
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            # ...the minimum must be in the left portion (including mid).
            right = mid - 1
            
    return res
```

### **Pattern 6: 2 Heaps for Median / Streaming Problems**

üß† **Core Idea:** To find the median in a stream of numbers, maintain two heaps: a **max-heap** for the smaller half of numbers and a **min-heap** for the larger half. By keeping the heaps balanced in size, the median is always accessible at the top of 1 or both heaps.

üí° **When to Use (Problem Triggers):**
*   "Find median from a data stream"
*   "Find the running median"
*   Problems requiring balancing two sets of numbers around a central point.

‚öôÔ∏è **The Code Template (as a class):**
```python
import heapq

# Generic template for median finding
class MedianFinder:
    def __init__(self):
        # Python's heapq is a min-heap. Use negative numbers for a max-heap.
        self.small_half = [] # Max-heap
        self.large_half = [] # Min-heap

    def addNum(self, num):
        # 1. Add to max-heap first
        heapq.heappush(self.small_half, -1 * num)
        
        # 2. Balance: ensure every number in small_half <= every number in large_half
        if self.small_half and self.large_half and (-1 * self.small_half[0]) > self.large_half[0]:
            val = -1 * heapq.heappop(self.small_half)
            heapq.heappush(self.large_half, val)
        
        # 3. Balance sizes: heaps can differ by at most 1
        if len(self.small_half) > len(self.large_half) + 1:
            val = -1 * heapq.heappop(self.small_half)
            heapq.heappush(self.large_half, val)
        if len(self.large_half) > len(self.small_half) + 1:
            val = heapq.heappop(self.large_half)
            heapq.heappush(self.small_half, -1 * val)
            
    def findMedian(self):
        # Logic to find median based on which heap is larger
        # ... (details in the problem)
```

‚úÖ **This class directly solves `Find Median from Data Stream`.**

### **Pattern 7: 2-Pass (Prefix & Suffix)**

üß† **Core Idea:** Some problems require context from *both the left and right* of an element. Solve this by iterating through the array once from left-to-right to build up a "prefix" array. Then, iterate again from right-to-left, using the prefix data to calculate the final result.

üí° **When to Use (Problem Triggers):**
*   "Product/sum of array except self"
*   Problems where `result[i]` depends on `items[0...i-1]` AND `items[i+1...n-1]`.

‚öôÔ∏è **The Code Template:**
```python
# Generic template
def two_pass_pattern(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    result = [1] * n
    
    # 1. First Pass: Left-to-Right (Calculate prefixes)
    prefix = 1
    for i in range(n):
        result[i] = prefix
        prefix *= nums[i]
        
    # 2. Second Pass: Right-to-Left (Calculate suffixes and final result)
    postfix = 1
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        result[i] *= postfix
        postfix *= nums[i]
        
    return result
```

‚úÖ **This template directly solves `Product of Array Except Self`.**
